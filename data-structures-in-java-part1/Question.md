## Section4: Arrays

**Q4-1** Reversing an array in-place

>The problem is that we want to reverse a **T[]** array in **O(N)** linear time complexity and we want the algorithm to be in-place as well - so the algorithm can not use additional memory!
>
>For example: input is **[1,2,3,4,5]** then the output is **[5,4,3,2,1]**
>
>Good luck!



Q4-2 Anagram problem

>Your task is to construct an algorithm to check whether two words (or phrases) are **anagrams** or not!
>
>"*An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once*"
>
>For example: `restful` and `fluster` are anagrams.
>
>Good luck!



> Duplicates in an array problem overview
>
> The problem is that we want to find duplicates in a **T[]** one-dimensional array of integers in **O(N)** running time where **the integer values are smaller than the length of the array** - and we can not use negative values!
>
> Good luck!
